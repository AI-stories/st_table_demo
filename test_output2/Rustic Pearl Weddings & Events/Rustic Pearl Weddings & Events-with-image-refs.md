Thank you for your interest in Rustic Pearl. I am pleased to say that we do currently have dates available in the Summer of 2025. When on our website the package that will best accommodate

your guest count is the Elegant package.

The cost listed is what it is. There is no tax or gratuity added. As far as vendors go we let you use any outside vendor you would like or you may use someone off of our list. I have included

our vendor list at the bottom of this email as well as the bar pricing guide. Bartender and security are the only two vendors that we require you use these specific ones. Security is $35

an hour per guard.

I would love to have you come in, show you around and discuss your special day in more detail.

I do have availability coming up. When would you like to come in and view?

Warm regards,

Stephanie Fischer, Owner
