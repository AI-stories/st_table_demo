Can I bring food for favors?
Yes, you can bring in little jars of candy or Hershey kisses on the tables. You cannot bring in little bottles of alcohol for all of your guests. If you are not sure, ask your catering manager.

Do I need a coordinator or planner?
We include a Month of Coordinator in our Ceremony Package.
We require a “Month of Coordinator” for events with a ceremony and/or a reception. I highly recommend upgrading to a planner, especially if you have extravagant décor and several vendors.

Do I need to use your vendor list?
If your coordinator and cake vendor are included in your contract, then yes, you must pick these from our Preferred Vendors List. All other vendors may be brought in, so long as they can provide proof of insurance with the hotel as additionally insured. Remember that you are creating a TEAM of creative players to bring your day to life. Your DJ and photographer are going to play a HUGE role in how the day goes. I would ask your catering manager and coordinator for recommendations on who they like to work with so your day can avoid any bumps.

Yes, you may have confetti or a guest flower toss by the lakeside and garden but it must be biodegradable. Yes, you can have a confetti cannon in the ballroom. We have a clean up fee of $100 per location confetti is used.
