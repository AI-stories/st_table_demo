**Frequently Asked Questions**

**What time can I set up?**

We do sell our space for lunch time event. however, we do allow for at least an hour of set up. We will contact your vendors the week or two weeks before with an exact load in time. If you plan on having an extreme installation (ex. white carpet throughout the space or full ballroom draping), please talk to your catering manager to arrange a set up block.

**Can my vendors pick up their things the morning after?**

Everything that is brought in, needs to be out the night of the event within 2 hours after the event concludes. Any excess time will incur a $500.00 labor fee for overtime of the hotel staff to stay.

**What if I want to bring favors, picture frames, linens, and DIY items?**

Do I have to set it up?

Please drop off items two days before your event with a complete inventory list and photos of how you want it set up. Your coordinator will be setting up all your favors and goodies.

**Can I bring in a candy bar or dessert bar?**

Yes, you can bring in your own candy bar, but we do have a $100 set up fee. Desserts must be purchased through our hotel. If there is something specific you want, please run it by your catering.
