Considering your estimated guest count of 100, our Commune is an ideal location for their upcoming wedding. The Commune is a total chameleon

space, fitting up to 150 guests. It's equipped with retractable glass walls, giving you that perfect indoor/outdoor vibe. Oh, and there's a sweet little

private pool and a spot just for your ceremony. After parties are no problem here either. You can either rent out the Commune until 1AM or

you can head over to our Amigo Room bar that is open until 2AM on Fridays and Saturdays.

For this location, you're looking at two fees - a site fee and a food and bev minimum. Prices depend on the day of the week and the season.

Unfortunately we don't have The Commune available for May 17th, 2025.

However we have it available for May 24th and 31st, 2025.

The site fee gets you:

●

six hours of event time (from when the ceremony kicks off)

●

●

●

●

●

●

●

all the tables and chairs you need house linen and napkins

dinnerware to rock your wedding feast projector

wireless mic and speaker for the ceremony tasting for two

marquee

●

staffing (a bartender fee may slide in depending on your package)

All the eats and drinks come straight from us, but feel free to bring in your dream team for flowers, decor, planning - you name it. Although a

wedding planner is not required, we suggest you save yourself the headache and hire one, you won't regret it. Take a peek at the attached

info and our catering menus for the full lowdown on pricing.

Wanna get a sneak peek of our spaces, guest rooms, and the whole vibe?

Check out this link for a virtual tour!

One more thing - we're all about good times, so we're asking for a minimum of 15 rooms over two nights booked with your wedding. We'll

hook you up with sweet discounted rates for your crew.
