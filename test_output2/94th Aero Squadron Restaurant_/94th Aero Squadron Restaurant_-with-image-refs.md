History of the 94th

Issue 2021

The94thAeroSquadronwasan

Air Service, United States Army unit that fought on the Western

Front during World War I.

The squadron was one of the first American fighter squadrons to see combat service. It

scored more victories than any other American

August 1917

The 94th was highly publicized in the

American print media of the time, and its exploits 'over there' were widely reported

on the home front.

Three notable air aces served with the squadron;

Eddie Rickenbacker, who was awarded almost every decoration attainable,

including the Medal of Honor and the

Distinguished Service Cross.

Douglas Campbell was the first American trained pilot to become an air ace. He

shared the honor of having the first official victory over an enemy aircraft with Alan

Winslow.

Raoul Lufbery, attained 17 aerial victories before leaping to his death from a fiery

Nieuport 28 aircraft in May 1918.

The squadron emblem, the 'Hat in the Ring'

became a symbol in the minds of the

American public of the American Air Service of WWI. The design was to resemble a

departure of the phrase tossing one's 'hat in the ring'- and was intended to honor the

United States entry into the war.

Rickenbacker was fond of the design, as he describes in his journal entry for April 12,

squadron during the First World War.

1918:

'Have been busy all day painting squadron insignia onmy plane. Ours is a most interesting one as we have Uncle Sam's

hat upside down in a ring with national colors-it's very good looking.'

After the 1918 Armistice with Germany, the squadron returned to the United States in June 1919

and became part of the permanent United States Army Air Service in 1921. The current United

States Air Force unit which holds its lineage and history is the 94th Fighter Squadron, assigned to the 1st Operations Group, Joint Base Langley- Eustis, Virginia.

Still in existence today, 94th Aero Squadron has a long rich history dating back to its humble beginnings in Texas on August 20, 1917 during WWI. 94th Aero Squadron Restaurants are

inspired by its founder's experience. As an aviator in WWII, David Tallichet flew over 20 missions in a B-17 Bomber and his passion for flying seen in our Restaurant here.
