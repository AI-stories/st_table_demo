Thank you for this information.

For something like this, it would need to be a full restaurant buyout.

With a full restaurant buyout, you will have access to three beautiful, spacious, Nickey

Kehoe designed dining rooms: the San Vicente Room, the Green Room, and the Main

Room for up to 150 total as a standing, cocktail style reception.

The price is $20,000

(Sun) or $26,000 (Fri/Sat) for up to 80 guests and $150 per person thereafter. This price includes private use of the restaurant, a specialty menu (food stations with tray passed

hors d'oeuvres are recommended), and beverages (sommelier select wine, specialty cocktails, and select-spirit open bar).

All prices are before tax, fees, and gratuity.

Please note, because you are dancing, we will need to have you bring in a dance floor to protect the floors, as well as additional insurance for your guests.
