**a.o.c. brentwood san vicente room, green room, main dining room & restaurant buyout information**

a.o.c. brentwood requires a signed event agreement and a deposit for 50% of your anticipated total within 24 hours to reserve the space and date. After 24 hours, the space will be made available to other inquiries unless other arrangements are made. Please keep in mind that the space and date are not reserved until a completed agreement and deposit are received by a.o.c. Cancellation (or rescheduling) of the event or the specified event date, with less than 14 days’ notice from the event date will result in forfeiture of the deposit.

## Event Agreement:

The tax is standard Los Angeles County 9.5% sales tax. The gratuity for the staff ranges between 18%-22%. A 6% charge is added to all checks to cover the cost of full healthcare benefits for our full-time employees; if you would like this charge removed, please let us know. In addition, a 5.5% administration fee will be added to the final bill.

## Tax, Gratuity & Fees:

There are male and female bathrooms located inside the restaurant. The bathroom would be available to other restaurant guests that are dining, unless buying out the entire restaurant.

## Bathroom:

a.o.c. brentwood is provided as a fully furnished dining space with beautiful, handcrafted wooden tables. Depending upon your specific needs and guest count, and particularly for reception layouts, it may be necessary to remove and store furniture for the duration of the event. Any removal and storage of furnishings will be the responsibility of the client and must be done prior to guest arrival. Table linens are not used at a.o.c.

## Seating:

Limited, metered street parking is available. a.o.c. brentwood does not have valet. Instead, there is a validated self-park lot just south of the restaurant on Darlington Ave. You may choose to host full validation for your guests’ parking for $19 per car. If you do not host parking, your guests will receive the standard 90-minute validation that a.o.c. brentwood offers to all guests. If you choose to host your guests’ parking, it will be charged post-event through the online portal.

## Parking:

All dining areas are located on the ground floor of a.o.c. brentwood and are ADA accessible.

# Basic Information

a.o.c. brentwood’s event selection of premium artisanal spirits, specialty cocktails and beer, are included in your dining experience. Satellite bars are discouraged therefore all spirits and cocktails will be prepared at a.o.c. brentwood’s bar. Menus that offer only the included spirits, cocktails and beers will be available for your guests. You are welcome to select one or two of a.o.c. brentwood’s specialty cocktails to be tray-passed to your guests upon arrival. Please include your selections when returning your menu selection and all other details.

## Liquor:

A white, red, sparkling and rosé wine will be selected by the sommelier from a.o.c. brentwood’s ever-evolving list of organically, biodynamically and sustainably produced boutique wines. Different wines or premium wines are available for the difference in cost, per bottle, beyond the included $50 price; wine upgrades must be arranged well in advance of your visit, and are based upon availability.

## Wine:

To be in compliance with State of California alcohol licensing restrictions, a.o.c. brentwood uses its discretion when serving wine, beer, and spirits. In order to maintain the safety of guests and employees, shots and the excessive consumption of alcohol are not allowed.

## Alcohol Consumption:

You are more than welcome to bring your own cakes, which can be presented and cut at no extra cost. Please tell us in advance and make sure that it is delivered, clearly-labeled with your name and date, in a fully enclosed box with instructions, including whether or not it needs to be refrigerated. Include your selections when returning your menu selection and all other details.

## Cake:

a.o.c. brentwood is able to accommodate a variety of allergies and food preferences. Please let us know as early as possible, particularly during the menu selection process. a.o.c. is not a kosher kitchen but is able to do kosher style.

## Allergies:

Because a.o.c. brentwood is a seasonal restaurant with the highest standards for its produce and proteins, menu selection will occur 2-3 weeks prior to your event to ensure the offerings are up to date. This includes our cocktail program as well. For plated meals, a.o.c. offers two dinner menus from which you can choose. You are welcome to make small changes and exchange similar dishes from one menu to the other. All changes are subject to chef approval.

## Menu Selection:

Lunch is served Wednesday – Friday. Brunch is served on Saturday and Sunday. All lunch & brunch menu options are a three-course menu with shared starters and desserts, and an individual choice of entrée, unless hosting a buffet.

## Lunch & Brunch:

a.o.c. brentwood’s menus can be enjoyed as a seated meal, or as a more casual buffet. Either way, Suzanne Goin’s farmers’ market-inspired menus are designed to be shared and enjoyed by all of your guests.

## Food:

# Food & Beverage

Daytime events must conclude by 3:00 pm. Licensing allows a.o.c. to remain open only one additional hour after the kitchen closes. Evening events that run beyond this time are subject to a penalty equal to twenty-five percent of the total cost of the event.

## Event End Time:

Copies of the a.o.c. cookbook are available for gifts to your guests at $35 per book.

## Additional Options:

With the exception of music playing throughout the restaurant, a.o.c. does not have or provide audio/video equipment such as microphones, projectors, screens, or monitors, although we are happy to offer references to companies who can provide these products and services.

## Audio/Visual

Printed menus will be provided for your guests for a seated meal, although not for a buffet arrangement. All menus will be printed in-house. If you would like to personalize the menus with a logo, title or date, please include that information when you return your menu selection. Menus of included beverages will be available for your guests, as well.

## Printed Menus:

Small, simple candles are provided on the tables for evening events. You may provide your own florals and/or candles, either through one of a.o.c. brentwood’s recommend vendors (list available upon request) or your own. Due to a.o.c. brentwood’s service of family-style, shared-plates, smaller and fewer floral arrangements are suggested (bud vases are highly recommended). All candles provided by guests shall be secured in a nonflammable solid holding device and protected by an enclosure, with the flames no closer than two inches from the top opening. The flame shall not be within twelve inches of foliage or other combustible material.

## Florals/Candles:

You are welcome to decorate with items that do not leave a lasting mark on the space. All items provided by clients must be removed at the conclusion of the event. Glitter, sparkles, confetti, helium- and mylar balloons and “silly string” are not allowed at a.o.c. brentwood.

## Decorations:

All pre-event deliveries must be coordinated with the events manager. For daytime events, items can be delivered on the same day, no more than half an hour before the restaurant opens for business.
